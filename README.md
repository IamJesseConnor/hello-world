Project Phantom

Hello you powerful people!

I am Jesse Connor. 
I am the man without a plan.
The guy with his head in the sky. 
The dude with a "LET's MAKE IT HAPPEN!" attitude!

I write from the mind of those with a story to tell. 

I like spending 8 hours a time playing Blizzard games and DoTA2 and spending over the odds on things I dont' use.

Here is my readme for Project Phantom.

THE biggest selling VR game of all time.
